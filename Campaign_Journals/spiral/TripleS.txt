__**admin@9/6/2020:**__ The headless knight provides vague messages:
Two. Towers.
Above. Lake. Blue. Magic.
Summit. God.
__**admin@9/6/2020:**__ Sildrarla comes across Jeremy the champion, a supposed commander of the communion of light, as well as one of the four rings. He invites Sildrarla to join his band, but she refuses
__**admin@9/6/2020:**__ Jeremy, as a parting word, tells Sildrarla to look for Fantoccini in Glimmerdrift if she wants more answers
__**admin@9/6/2020:**__ Samuel's room turned out to have smell of excretion, of unknown cause.
__**admin@9/6/2020:**__ In the morning, they head towards the entrance towards lastfell fortress, learning about the existence of Mythmire, a land below the cliff, full of those who are dangerous
__**admin@9/6/2020:**__ They meet the band of female knights, with the flag of communion of light, and as samuel attempts to flirt with them, the vice commander scares him off.
__**admin@9/6/2020:**__ Earlier in the day, because they saved a commoner from grayroach, trying to thieve their fortunes, they are invited to their house to have dinner and lodging. They tell the band of TripleS that their 3 older siblings are out doing work in the world.
__**admin@9/6/2020:**__ In the house, they meet Bethia and Andrew, the youngest kids of the family. Andrew seems to grow attachment towards Sezare, while Sildrarla and Samuel push the kids away
__**admin@9/6/2020:**__ The next day, they visit Theffania at the farm, a supposed retired adventurer, and provides many useful information about the world, such as the existence of the 4 major powers in the world, as well as how to get past the ballista in embalming lake
__**sezare@12/6/2020:**__ Sezare bandaged Quinn the Armless, as he was mortally wounded from a fight with Jeremy of the four rings. They were childhood friends, though no longer on friendly terms. Sildrarla stole his purse.
__**sezare@12/6/2020:**__ TripleS entered embalming lake, where they were attacked by an Eagle (clearly an evil creation of some twisted madman) and 4 goblins. With a lexical dart and a firebomb, they passed through, clearing the balista, and moved on to the Tower of Scholars.
__**sezare@12/6/2020:**__ We entered the Tower of Scholars, passing by a bandaged crippled noble, their maid and the reappearing blue-haired girl. The maid directed us toward the workshop to figure out where to deliver our package.
__**sezare@12/6/2020:**__ We then met Ehnun, where Sildara bought two books and Sezare decided he doesn't like the children of the timeless mind (their religion is contradictory and stupid).

	"description": "A small cylinder, able to draw one of: `additional modifiers`, `skill points`, `HP` and `spell castings` from target it is linked to. It can draw up to 90% of the target's capacity, rounded up. Can be used by taking a bite into the pre-linked cylinder, and screaming the attribute you want to draw. Only usable to those with no magic resistance. \nTo link the battert to a target, one must throw the battery at the target, and shout 'You are mine now'. After use of the cylinder for oneself, the target is notified of what happened.",

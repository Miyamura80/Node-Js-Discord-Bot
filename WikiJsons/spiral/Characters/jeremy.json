He is one of the 4 Grand Rings [3]",
	
	"combat": "Ability-Obtainyd: Once Jeremy observes someone fight, Jeremy can simulate their combat capabilities, range, application, weakness in his head for 30 minutes in parallel to his normal function, giving him near perfect strategy to any opponent at the end of the simulation. Jeremy fights with his legendary spear Tribesca [4], used defensively during the simulation, and offensively after he gains a strategy. He often leads his troops to battle, using his simulation ability to gain a stronger understanding of unit positioning.",
